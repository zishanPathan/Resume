- **Content Organization**: The resume is thoughtfully organized, with sections dedicated to my education, work experience, skills, projects, and contact information. This clear structure makes it easy for visitors to find relevant information.

- **CSS Styling**: I had demonstrated expertise in CSS styling, utilizing fonts, colors, and typography to create a visually appealing and readable document. The design choices reflect attention to detail and a keen eye for aesthetics.
